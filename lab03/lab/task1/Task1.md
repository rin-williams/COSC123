# Task 1: Create a paper-based sketch (on paper or on a tablet)

Often in Processing it is essential to have rough draft or sketch of your final product before you dive into your drawing.
It is not essential for your final Drawing in Processing to exactly match your rough draft (similar to the rough draft of an essay or presentation), but it does help to have a "North Star" to guide you on your Processing journey.

In this task, **create a sketch of a Processing drawing you want to create using pen/pencil and paper**, or a tablet, or other drawing program such as [SketchPad](https://sketch.io/sketchpad/), Paint, etc...
Be creative, think beyond the basics of what we did in Lecture Activity 3 (drawing of a simple character).

## Specifications

- The sketch must be meaningful and non-trivial - in Task 2 you will be implementing it using Processing, so don't go overboard!
- Some element of creativity and sophistication.
- Add a screenshot of your drawing to the `screenshots` directory.

## Embed a screenshot of your drawing

Embed the screenshot you added to the `screenshots` directory here using markdown syntax:
