# Task 2: Turn your sketch into a Processing Drawing

Now that you have a paper-based sketch, you can convert your sketch into a Processing Drawing.

## Specifications

- We are expecting you to commit your work often (try to aim for a minimum of 3-5 commits per lab) with useful commit messages marking your progress.
- Your processing drawing should be "close-enough" to your paper-based sketch from Task 1.
- Use a Bezier curve.
- Use at least 3 different types of primitive shapes (in addition to a Bezier curve).
- Use at least 2 different RGB colors.
- Use at least 2 different HSB colors.
- Including some text in your design.
- Use different stroke weights and colors.
- Your work should be "distinguished" and effortful (e.g. better designs, complex compositions, better colors choices and combinations).
- Add a screenshot of your drawing to the `screenshots` directory.

## Embed a screenshot of your drawing

Embed the screenshot you added to the `screenshots` directory here using markdown syntax:
