# Task 1 - Nested for Loops

A) Shiffman Exercise:

- Create a grid of squares, each colored randomly, using a for loop.
- Recode the same pattern using a while loop instead of for.

B) Generate the grid of squares in the lower figure.

- Note that each square is colored in a way that the window has a gradient shading.
  each square has an outline that is slightly lighter in color than the fill color.

## Embed a screenshot of your drawing

Embed the screenshot you added to the `screenshots` directory here using markdown syntax:
![task 1 sc](/lab/screenshot/task1.png)

## I can't fine tune this so this is the close one I can get for the second part.

![task 1 v2 sc](/lab/screenshot/task1v2.png)
