# Lecture Activity 1

## 1. Have you ever used GitHub before? Yes/No

- No

## 2. Explain - in your own words - what you think is meant by "version control" (you're welcome to look it up, just don't plagiarize!)

- I believe it's the process of tracing and organizing versions that has been changed on a certain type of application and such.

## 3. Explain - in your own words - what you think is the difference between Git and GitHub.

- Git is like a raw version of GitHub. Git enables you to push updates to GitHub without being in GitHub itself. the difference is that Git is a CLI and GitHub is more UI-friendly.
