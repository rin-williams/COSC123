# Task 3

Here is a print statement in java: ```System.out.println("Hello World!");``` but you can also do this ```System.out.print("Hello World");```

Now here is an example of a for-loop function in java:

```
num = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++){
    num++;
}
//System.out.print(num); will print 10
```
